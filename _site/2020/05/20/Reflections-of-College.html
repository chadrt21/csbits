<p>In reflecting my college experience I wanted to share my advice to those computer science students either about to enter college or are already in college.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>TLDR;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Have projects to show your work and education</li>
  <li>Do internships (if possible)</li>
  <li>Clubs and competitions</li>
  <li>Connect with professors and career center</li>
  <li>Keep learning (on your own)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="have-projects-to-show-your-work-and-education">Have projects to show your work and education</h3>
<p>Working on and storing your school and personal projects (or even your homework) on Github can be a great way to build your portfolio. Often employers and interviewers will want to look at work that you have done to see what kind of skills you have.</p>

<h3 id="do-internships-if-possible">Do internships (if possible)</h3>
<p>Unfortunately I didn’t participate in an any internships while I was in college. In retrospect I would definitely have done an internship. Internships are a great way to get experence in the industry as well as develop connections with those in the industry thus making it easier to get a computer science job after college.</p>

<h3 id="clubs-and-competitions">Clubs and competitions</h3>
<p>Clubs are a great way to connect with other students in your field.</p>

<p>Competitions such as hackathons and coding competitions are a great way to test your computational knowledge and skills. Below are some competitions that I would recommend paratisipating in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://icpc.global/">ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)</a></p>

    <p>Participants are given 10 problems and 3 hours to solve as many of them as you can</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://nationalcyberleague.org/">National Cyber League (NCL)</a></p>

    <p>Solve cyber security challenges in a safe environment in 9 different domains:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open Source Intelligence</li>
      <li>Cryptography</li>
      <li>Password Cracking</li>
      <li>Log Analysis</li>
      <li>Network Traffic Analysis</li>
      <li>Forensics</li>
      <li>Web App Exploitation</li>
      <li>Scanning</li>
      <li>Enumerations &amp; Exploitation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://mlh.io/">Major League Hacking</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://js13kgames.com/">JS13k Games</a></p>

    <p>Make a game using HTML and JavaScript but the trick is that it has to be 13 kilobytes or smaller. This contest is a great way to practice JavaScript and game development.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="connect-with-professors-and-career-center">Connect with professors and career center</h3>
<p>Your professors are an excellent source for advice and reference as most of them likely have had experience in the computer science industry. As such they can advise you on what skills to work on as well as maybe refer you to a company either for a job or intership.</p>

<p>The career center is an important place to get advice on resume building, interviews, and other soft skills that are needed in order to, no only get a job, but also keep a job<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. It is important to keep in mind that you will likely apply to many places and either not hear from them or get rejected but don’t dispair; keep working on your skills and apply to companies that are looking for your skills. The career center can help you increase your likelyhood of getting an interview<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="keep-learning-on-your-own">Keep learning (on your own)</h3>
<p>While getting a college degree is impressive it does not guarantee you a job. During your time at college, if you have the time, I strongly recommend learning a new skill; whither that be a programming language or a project to play with what you learned in class. College will only teach you so much; they are there to help teach you the basics of computer science but once you graudate there are always skills that you can learn. I would recommend learning JavaScript as there are not many schools that I know of that teach JavaScript but it is often used in the industry (at least for software engineering).</p>

<p>I would recommend having a blog in which you can showcase your projects and skills.</p>
